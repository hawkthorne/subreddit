[![/r/hawkthorne preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hawkthorne/subreddit/master/thumbnail.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hawkthorne/subreddit/master/preview.png)

This is a collection of assets that make up most style and substance for the [/r/hawkthorne](http://reddit.com/r/hawkthorne) subreddit of the fan-made game, [Journey to the Center of Hawkthorne](https://github.com/hawkthorne/hawkthorne-journey) based on Community's [Digital Estate Planning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Estate_Planning) episode.

## Naut

This subreddit's style uses [Naut](https://github.com/Axel--/Naut-for-reddit) as a base to build on top of.

## Features

- Animated large header image
- Customized sidebar style to highlight OS specific downloads of the game
- User flair that mirrors the top 7 poster's user flair in the sidebar image

## Todo

- Separate `compiled.css` into `.less` components that can be compiled on their own
- Submit fixes and various tweaks that have been made upstream back to Naut
- Only show large header on "hot" page and come up with smaller header on other pages?
- Uniquely style **Release** posts of the game beyond just a sticky post
